# Project Brief: Preparing for Influenza Season
## Goal:
This project aims to assist a medical staffing agency in planning for the influenza season when hospitals and clinics experience a surge in demand for temporary staff. The analysis will identify trends in influenza to proactively plan staffing needs across the country.

## Business Requirements:
Gathering and curating relevant data
Analyzing data to draw conclusions and make recommendations
Presenting insights to stakeholders in a clear and accessible manner
While this project focuses on healthcare, the framework can be applied to projects in other domains.

## Project Overview:
### Motivation:
Influenza season in the U.S. leads to increased hospitalizations, particularly among vulnerable populations. Clinics and hospitals need additional staff to manage this influx, provided by a medical staffing agency.
### Objective: 
Determine the timing and number of temporary staff to deploy across different states.
Scope: This project covers all hospitals in the 50 U.S. states to prepare for the upcoming influenza season.
### Stakeholders:
1. Medical agency frontline staff (nurses, physician assistants, doctors)
2. Hospitals and clinics using the staffing agencyâ€™s services
3. Influenza patients
4. Staffing agency administrators

## Assumptions & Constraints:
### Assumptions:
Vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, children, and individuals with preexisting conditions) are most likely to experience severe flu complications.
Flu shots reduce the likelihood of infection.
### Constraints:
The staffing agency has a limited number of nurses, physician assistants, and doctors.
No budget is available for hiring additional medical personnel.

## Data Sets:
#### Influenza Deaths by Geography
Source: CDC
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
#### Population Data by Geography, Age, and Gender
Source: US Census Bureau
(Note: Population data are estimates, so sums across age groups may not exactly match overall totals, which is acceptable.)
